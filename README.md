## Instructions and Winning the Game

The Arcade Game Clone begins with a one player character at the bottom of a game screen.  The game screen is divided into three sections; grass, a roadway and water.  The player character can be moved one square at a time using the keyboard arrow keys.  The game is won when the character navigates across the game board to any of the water tiles.  Enemy characters are three insects which move along the roadway tiles from left to right.  Coming in contact with any of the bugs will cause the player character return to the original start position at the beginning of the game.


## Requirements

In order to play the game you must have a web browser installed on your computer.


## What to expect

The game has loaded correctly if you see game grid populated by game tiles marking out grass, roadway and water with three bugs moving across the screen from left to right and a player charter at the center bottom. The character will move one square at a time using the arrow keys but will not move off the screen.
